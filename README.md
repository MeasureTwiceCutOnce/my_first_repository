Writing code in the Github editor seems pretty cool. I guess I won't be using it much though. I would like to see a Google Docs for code. Why can't we use Docs, but just export as a txt file? Seems doable to me. Though without the shortcuts and assistance of modern editors, would be laborious.
I am adding some more text here in order to have a change occur, so I can do another commit to this repo. Why does vim think repo is a bad word?




This is a file that is going to posted to my repo. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
